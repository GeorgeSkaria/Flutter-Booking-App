# Flutter-Booking-App
This is a basic ongoing Flutter application that simulates a booking app with two screens: HomeScreen and BookScreen. The app allows users to interact with voice commands, input travel details, and check available buses.

# Features:
HomeScreen: The app starts with the HomeScreen, where the user is greeted with a centered title "BOOKMYTRIP". It provides options for a voice assistant, and a button to navigate to the BookScreen.

Voice Assistant: Users can click on the "Voice Assistant" button or use the microphone icon to interact with a voice assistant.

BookScreen: Upon clicking "Book Ticket here," the user is taken to the BookScreen. This screen allows users to input their departure and destination locations using text fields. The "Check Available buses" button enables users to search for available buses.

Navigation: Users can navigate back to the HomeScreen from the BookScreen using the "BACK" button located at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
